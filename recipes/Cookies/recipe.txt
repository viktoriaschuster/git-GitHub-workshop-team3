# Chocolate chip cookies
# 1 In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.
# 2 Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.
# 3 Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).
# 4 Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.
# 5 Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
# 6 Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.
# 7 Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the edges have started to barely brown.
# 8 Cool completely before serving.
